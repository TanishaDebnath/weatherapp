🌦 Just launched my *Weather App*—a unique blend of functionality and aesthetics! 🌟

Unlike typical apps, it features:
- *Dynamic Backgrounds*: Moving clouds from 6 AM to 6 PM; a live aurora after 6 PM to 6 AM.
- *Real-Time Insights*: Current weather, 5-day forecast, wind speed, sunrise/sunset—all responsive.
- *AI Chatbot*: A floating assistant on the right for personalized weather advice via Gemini API.

 Real-World Impact 🌍
- *Planning*: Helps users plan with accurate forecasts and sunrise/sunset times.
- *Engagement*: Immersive backgrounds make weather checking delightful.
- *Accessibility*: AI chatbot offers quick, conversational guidance.

At 05:58 PM IST on June 14, 2025, enjoy the sunny sky with drifting clouds—aurora kicks in soon! ☀🌙
